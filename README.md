# Boot my App

The topic of this talk is to expose what is the current state of the art about bootstrap,
build and package a modern web application. By modern web application I mean 100% HTML.
During this talk I will introduce several tools and practices to help us in our quest of productivity,
structuration and quality.

Building an App is a long process and can be described by the following lifecycle.

First you have to structure your App. Set up the bases, the scaffolding.
Initiate the build proccess. Define the tree structure.

Then you have to develop. Fast and efficiently. Keeping in mind quality along all this phase.

Not really after but in the same time you have to test your developments.

Then when everything is ok, you have to prepare your App for the production. Optimize andÂ·package all this.

And finally we can push our great App on the cloud.

Now let's see all this steps and how can we use tools or best practices to improve our experience.
